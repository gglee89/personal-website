# Main file

The main file (usually labelled `main.scss`) should be the only Sass file from the whole code base not to begin with an underscore. This file should not contain anything but `@import` and comments.

_Note: when using [Eyeglass](https://github.com/sass-eyeglass/eyeglass) for distribution, it might be a fine idea to name this file `index.scss` rather than `main.scss` in order to stick to [Eyeglass modules specifications](https://github.com/sass-eyeglass/eyeglass#writing-an-eyeglass-module-with-sass-files). See [#21](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate/issues/21) for reference._

# Sass Boilerplate

This is a sample project using the [7-1 architecture pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) and sticking to [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es) writing conventions.

Each folder of this project has its own `README.md` file to explain the purpose and add extra information. Be sure to browse the repository to see how it works.

## Using the indented syntax

### Sass conversion

This boilerplate does not provide a `.sass` version as it would be painful to maintain both versions without an appropriate build process. However, it is very easy to convert this boilerplate to Sass indented syntax.

Clone it, head into the project and then run:

```
sass-convert -F scss -T sass -i -R ./  && find . -iname “*.scss” -exec bash -c 'mv "$0" “${0%\.scss}.sass"' {} \;
```

### Use with Node-sass

When using `node-sass` - in order to build that boilerplate, one needs to:

- install `node-sass` if not yet installed:

```bash
npm install -g node-sass
```

- run build command from command line:

```bash
node-sass stylesheets/main.scss dist/main.css
```
